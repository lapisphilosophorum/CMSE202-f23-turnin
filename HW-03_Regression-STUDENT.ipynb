Because of Simpson's Paradox, where a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.

For the measurement input of the penguin, I will create a feature vector that matches the format of the trained model. I will then run this vector through each of the three models. Each model predicts the likelihood of a penguin belonging to its respective species. The final classification will be based on which model gives the highest probability of predicting the penguin species. This strategy effectively allows models to compete against each other, with the highest confidence score winning. The predicted species will be the species for which the model is most certain of its classification based on the measurements provided."
